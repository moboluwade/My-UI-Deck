Chill people don't look for reasons or opportunities to hate on others just for being different. There's no reason to bully or tread on other people's territory. Try to be happy with yourself and encourage self-love in others, too and remember be yourself.",
                "Unless someone is rude to you, your day should go by smoothly by being polite, considerate, and nice. Chill people don't antagonize for the sake of it or stir up a bunch of negative emotions by being jerks; chill people are generally kind and get along well with others. However, try to avoid going overboard so you don't become a people-pleaser or pushover.",
                "Don't sweat the small stuff. Take your life in stride. Roll with the punches and be accepting of the little things life throws your way, reserving your passion for what matters to you most. This is pretty much the defining feature of a chill person."

                "Make and follow your own trends. Be unique. A chill person doesn't feel the need to follow all the trends set by others, they just do what they want and what makes them happy.

From here, you can redirect the situation to be in your favor.",

Does it even help to be so hard on yourself? If you made it out alive, chances are you’ll find a way to get through it and move on to more happiness and hardships.",
